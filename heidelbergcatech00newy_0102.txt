9 2 HISTORICAL INTRODUGTION.

Then, as we have said, the structure of the work is not theoretical,
but prevailingly practical. It is not a system of knowledge merely
for the understanding, in which the truths of religion are set forth in
the character of abstract thought and general theologica] doctrine3 it
is a representation rather of the great facts of religion in their own
