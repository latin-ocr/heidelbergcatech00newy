88 HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION.

Calvinistic points to Which we have now referred are at least involved
or implicated in its general system of doctrine. So it must have
seemed, of course, to that part of the Reformed communion, for which
these points had become of confessional authority; since it could not
otherwise have been indorsecl, as it was for instance by the Synod of
Dort, as sound and orthodox. But this only shows that the Cate-
chism leaves these points untouched3 allowing room thus, as the Bible
itself also does, for different methods of carrying out its general
doctrine. These strong Calvinistic positions hold beyond its practical
horizon. The Belgio Church might consider them necessary to com· ·

opportunity for such difference. The authors of it seem to have held
their own theologica] convictions purposely in a certain measure of
abeyance, in order that they might be true to the church life around
them3 Which, as we know, included much that could never have been
satisfied with extreme Calvinism on the subject of the decrees. Or
rather perhaps, as we shall see presently, the peculiar order and
method of their work, after it had been once fairly adopted, served to
determine its reigning character here, with a sort of inward necessity

Some have gone so far as to charge the Catechism with contra-
dicting itself, because it is thus comprehensive in its views 3 appearing
occasionally to favor in one direction, what it may be thought to
oppose again in another. But in this it only resembles the broad
comprehensiveness of the Sacred Scriptures themselves3 which also
countenance, in some cases, what seem to be conflicting views3 though
