for body and soul ; and further, that.whatever evils He sends upon

Another Classical example truly of the reigning mind, as well as of the
peculiar force and. beauty, of the Catechism.

Take again the 32d question, where, after the explanation of the
name Christ, or Anointed, in its reference to our Saviour’s threefold
office of Prophet, Priest, and King, it is suggestively asked: “But

a strong temptation to quote them, certainly, in the intrinsic beauty
of the questions themselves. But we find it necessary to forbear, and
