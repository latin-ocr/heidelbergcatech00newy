HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 33

we find him at work, in the year 1560, in the Sapienz-college, and
somewhat later in the theological faculty also of the university 3 from
both of which situations, however, as we have already seen, he was
relieved the following year by UrsinUS, whose talents more especially
fitted him for such academie service, while it seemed desirable to make
use of the peculiar gifts of Olevianus in a more practical and popular
way. By general consent, he was called to occupy the pulpit, first in St.

AUTHORSHIP OF THE HEIDELBERG CATECHISM.

Such were the men to whom the Elector intrusted the responsible

office, we shall find no less occasion for surprise in considering the way
in which the appointment was fulfilled.

It is something wonderful, in the first place, that the Catechism
should be in fact the production of two authors ; for it appears to be
certain, that the double authorship in this case was of the most real
and positive character, involving throughout not simply an outward,
but a true inward cooperation also, which it is curious to note,

and by no means easy to understand. The Catechism was not the

of both ; and it was this, not in the way of any mechanical putting
together of their different contributions to the work, but in the way
rather of an organic fusion, which refers the whole work to both
authors, and makes it impossible to know or say, what in it belongs to

one and what to the other. This curious fact, moreover, becomes still
