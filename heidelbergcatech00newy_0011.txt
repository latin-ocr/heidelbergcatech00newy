PREFAOE. 5

and published in the same year with the approval of the Elector. We have edited
the text from a Genevan edition, which has the following title: ‘⁶ CATECHEsm
anemms CHRISTIANAE, QUAE IN Eocmsns ET Sonous ELECTORALIS PALATINATUS
TRADITUR. A Friderico Sylburgio Wetterano Graece conversa. Genevae. Apud
Matthaeum Berjon, M.DO.1X.” No liberty has been taken with the language of
this edition, or more specifically, with the words of the text3 but the punctuation
being defective, we have modified it, by an application of the same general princl-
ples which have regulated us in determining the punctuation of the Modern German
and the English.

The Latin translation, as regards classic style and fidelity to the original, pos-
sesses only ordinary merit. Here and there, words and phrases are added. In some
instances, the language is a paraphrase instead of a translation; in others it fails to
give the true sense of the original German. It cannot, accordingly, be assigned a
place beside the original text. It has no normal authority. Yet it possesses great
value for the purposes of reference and comparison.

The Modern German text is edited on the basis of the original Catechism as pub-
lished by N iemeyer, no clause or word being allowed to stand unless warranted by
this criterion of judgment. It differs from the old text only in so far as the German
language of to-day itself differs from the German language in use three hundred
years ago, The difference pertains to orthography, the inflection of nouns and
verbs, the gender of nouns, and to certain words and idioms which are now nearly
or altogether obsolete. In the execution of this part of the work, the Committee
acknowledges the valuable cooperation of the Rev. Prof. Philip Schaff, D. D.

Taking the original text, furnished by Dr. Niemeyer in his collectio Confes-
sionum, as the basis, the Committee has diligently compared the following works:
Der Heidelberqer catechismus, by Ernst G. A. Bockel, in his work entitled, Die Be-
kennmiszsclzrzjften der evanqelisck-rqformirten ffirche, pp. 395-424 3 an edition dated
at Heidelberg, Sept. l'st, 1684 ; the official edition of 1724 “ Nach dem Exemplar de
Ao. 1684 revidirt,” and embodied in the thcr-Pfdltzische Kirclzen- Ordnunq ,· 172⁶
IIeidelberq Cateclzism, published in the German translation, by Dr. F. A. Lampe, of
Dr. John D'Outrein’s &alden K leinod der Lehre der Wahrheicg Bremen, 17213 a
reprint of the Catechism contained in Christoph Stahelin’s Catachetiselzer Hause-
Schatz, first published at St. Gall, in 1724 ; and a number of later editions issued in
Europe and America, which it is deemed unnecessary to notice in detail.
