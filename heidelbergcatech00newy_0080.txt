70 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

any other, to become of classical authority for the Church at large.
But this, with all others, gave way in such view to the new Catechism
of the Palatinate. While other Catechisms continued to be provincial
only, or national, this assumed more and more the character of a
catholic or general symbol. So while each country had also its own
Confession of Faith, Helvetic, Gallie, Belgic, 01· otherwise, the Heidel-

freedom, as 3 common bond of union for the whole Church. It was
welcomed and applauded in Switzerland, France, England, Scotland,
and Holland, as well as by 311 who were friendly to the Reformed
faith in Germany itself. Nor was this praise transient, an ephemeral
burst of favor, followed again by general neglect. On the contrary,
the authority of the Catechism grew with its age. It became the Cate-

Church. In this character, we find it quoted and appealed to, on all
sides, by both friends and foes. It formed the text book of theology
in learned universities. Profound divines (UrsinUS, Alting, Piscator,
Cocceius, Schultens, and others) have made it in this way the basis of
their dogmatic systems. Innumerable pulpits and schools have lent their
aid to give it voice and power in the world. It has been as the daily
bread of the sanctuary 10 11111110115, generation after generation. Never
has a Catechism been more honored, in the way of translations, com-

scattered, like leaves of the forest, in countless editions from the press.
Such vast popularity creates at once a powerful presumption in
favor of the book, as it goes also to show us something of its peculial·
character and constitution. The different ’1131101131 branches of the
