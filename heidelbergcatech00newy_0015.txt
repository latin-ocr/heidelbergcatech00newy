PREFAOE. 7

year, committed the matter to Dr. Laidlie, and appointed three members of the Con-
sistory as a committee of conference. In J uly, a copy of the prepared Heidelberg
Catechism was laid before the Consistory, and, after comparing it with the Dutch
text and the former translation, was unanimously approved 3 but it did not appear in
print until 17 67, when it was published and bound up with the Book of Psalms. In
the preface to this work the Catechism is represented to be a revision of a transla-
tion 3* the translation, no doubt, from an unknown source, which was previously
used, in Holland, among the refugees from England. It is the Catechism in this
revised form of Dr. Laidlie, which, in 1771, was formally adopted by the Synod of
the Protestant Reformed Dutch Church, and during the second and third decades
of the present century, when the English language began to prevail among the Ger-
mans, passed over, though without any formal Synodical sanction, into the German
Reformed Church, where it has continued in general use to the present time.
³ The new English text, prepared by the Committee, differs from the received text,

and, so far as known, from all previous English versions, in being a translation, not
of the Latin or Dutch, but of the original German. The Committee has been gov-
erned, in making the translation, by three leading principles: First, to translate only
from the German edition of 1563, as being the ultimate standard of judgment, and
refer to translations and all subsequent German editions, not as possessing coordinate
authority, but as subordinate aids to the correct understanding of the original.
We have accordingly, as in the Modern German text, eliminated every word that
has crept into later editions, but is not supported by the text of the ultimate
standard. Secondly, to make a faithful translation. It has been the aim of the
Committee to express the true sense of the German correctly in the idioms of the
English language, without weakening or strengthening a single phase of thought.
Thirdly, to employ AnyZo-Saoeon words3 avoiding, as far as practicable, the use of
Latin and Greek derlvatives.

The language of the received text has been adopted to the extent that it could
be done consistently with the free operation of these principles.

The Committee-has edited the Creed in Modern German and English. The

drawn them from records of the Dutch Chureh. In a private letter to the chairman of the Committee, he
remarks: ‘⁴1 think the evidence conclusive that the edition used in our churches and yours is a careful
revision from the former translation, made by Dr. Laidlie.”
