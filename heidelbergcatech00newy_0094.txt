benefit of this glorious redemption, however, only those of the race
come, who are united to Christ by faith3 which involves the living
apprehension, not simply of an abstract doctrine, but of the whole
perennial fact of Christianity itself, as we have it embodied in the<

before, is again significantly silent. Not only does it shrink from
asserting the supralapsarian theory of the decrees—the fall and ruin
of the whole race ordained from all eternity, in order to open the way
for the predetermined salvation of a certain limited number of the
