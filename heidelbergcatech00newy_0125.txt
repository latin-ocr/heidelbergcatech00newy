HISTORIOAL IN TRODUCTION. 1 1 5

Reformed Church in this country, Dutch, Scotch, or German, (to say
nothing now of the Episcopal Church, or of the Congregationalism of
New England), can be said to stand here firmly, on the ground which
was occupied by their religious ancestry in the beginning. There is
not the same faith among them which there was of old in sacramental

to honor or force, in any other connection. Where the old idea of
educational religion, based on the sense of covenant relation to God
and baptisma] grace, has come to be regarded with distrust3 where
