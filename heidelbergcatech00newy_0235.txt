QUEs'moN 85.

How is the lcinqdom of heaven
shut and opened by Okurch Dis-
cq'pline ?

ANSWER.
In this way: that according to

¹the command of Christ, if any un-

der the Christian name show them-

selves unsound either in doctrine
or life, and after repeated brotherly
admonition refuse to turn from
their errors or evil ways, they are
complained of to the church or to
its proper officers‚ and, if they neg·
lect to hear them also, are by them
excluded from the Holy Sacraments
and the Christian communion, and
by God Himself from the kingdom
of Christ3 and if they promise and
show real amendment, they are
again received as members of Christ

and His Chmch.
