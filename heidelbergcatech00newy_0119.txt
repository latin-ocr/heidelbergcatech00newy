HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 109

become an animal 3 so in the spiritual world also it is not possible, by
mere nurture of any sort, to carry the evolution of life beyond the
principles and germs which are already imbedded in its own constitu-
tion. This applies emphatically to the new creation in Christ. It can
never be brought to pass, in the way of simple derivation from the
powers and possibilities of our common human nature, in its fallen
Adamic state. That which is born of the flesh-we are solemnly
assured—is fiesh3 it remains as such hopelessly bound to its own
sphere, and can in no way be brought to transcend it. If it were
pretended then to take such as by their natural birth are in this state

involve a contradiction to think or to speak of building them up as
Christians in any such way. Then the modern Puritanic or Baptistic
sentiment after 311 would be right, and the old Catholic sentiment

thinking, as a matter of course, the old catechetical system, the old
sacramenta] system, the old church system in general, can never appear
reliable and satisfactory3 for the simple reason that it has no faith
