It is instead of the one 'crue God
Who has revealed Himself in His
word, or along with the same, to
conceive or have something else on
which to place our trust.

QUESTmN 96.
What does God mequire in the

second commaozdment ?

ANSWER.

That we in nowise make any
image of God, nor worship Him in
any other way than He has com-
manded in His word.

QUESTION 97.
Must we then ‘not make any im-
aqe at all .?

ANSWER.

God may not and cannot be im-
aged in any way; as for oreatmes,
though they may indeed be im-
aged, yet God forbids the making
or keeping any likeness of them,
either to worship them, or by them
to serve Himself.
