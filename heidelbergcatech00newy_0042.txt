34 HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION.

more curious, when regard is had to the difference of temperament and
nature, which we know to have existed between the two men. They

of less than a single year. It was the will of the Prince that his
favorite measure for the reformation of the Palatinate, should as quickly
