age. It belonged of right, we may say, to the history of the Refor-
mation.

It was in the bosom of the Lutheran Church, primarily, that the
new sacramental war was engendered. There had been here, since
1536, a broad, though quiet, and to a great extent unconscious, falling
away from the extreme view of the great Reformer, as we find it ex.
pressed in the original Augsburg Confession. Under the influence of
this mitigated sentiment, Melancthon, the illustrious author of the Con-

at Strasburg, had no difficulty in subscribing to the Confession in such

affairs of the Lutheran Church, on that basiS, without any sort of

to cast the late-born Protestantism of the Palatinate. It was to be
Lutheran; it was to have for its standard the Augsburg Confession3
no one thought of anything else3 but it must be Lutheranism in the
most free and comprehensive sense of the term, such as all could sub-
