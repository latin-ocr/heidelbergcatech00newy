14 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

mass was about to be celebrated, struck up suddenly the popular Protes-
tant hymn, Es ist das Heil was kommen her ,· signifying in such strange
way their wish to have done, once and for all, with the old religion
and worship. This memorable event took place on Sunday, the ,aoth
of December, 1545, and at once determined the Elector in favor of the
Reformation. It was ordered that the service of the mass should be
held in the vernacular language, that the sacrament should be dis-
tributed in both kinds, and that the priests should be allowed to
marry. The very next year, however, all was changed again by the
unfortunate issue of the war of Smalcald 3 in consequence of which the
so-called Interim of the Emperor Charles V. was forced upon the
Palatinate, bringing along with it, in fact, a restoration of the Catholic
system to its former authority and power. But it was after all a tem-
porary repression only of the Protestant movement, and not its full
arrest. Four years later, the power of the Emperor was unexpectedly
broken by Maurice of Saxony, and he found himself compelled, in the
famous Pacification of Passau, to consent to the religious freedom of
the German States. The Peace of Augsburg followed in 1555.
Frederick took new heart in favor of the Reformation, introduced an
evangelica] church service, and on the llth of November, 1555, opened
in the Augustinian convent at Heidelberg, the famous Sapienz-college,
as it was called, for the education of ministers. It was only, however,
under the following prince, Otho fleury, who had long been devoted to
the new religion, and who succeeded his uncle, Frederick, in the year 1556,
that the Protestant cause became fully established in the Palatinate.

But now, unfortunately, the Protestantism of Germany was no
longer in harmony with itself; and its inward divisions threw them-
selves at once in full force on the infancy of this new Church, threaten-
ing it with universal confusion.
