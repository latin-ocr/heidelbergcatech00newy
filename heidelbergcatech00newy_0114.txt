104 · HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.” Let
the fact of your election, with its glorious opportunities, privileges,
and powers, engage you to all diligence (2 Pet. 1 : 10) in making “your
calling and election sure.” Having such promises (2 Cor. 7 : 1), “let -
us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the fiesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.’⁷ Such is the tenor everywhere of these
N ew Testament instructions and exhortations. All relations, for those
addressed, are held to be Christian relations3 all duties, growing out
of them, find their ultimate sense and force only in Christ. He is the
principle of the new ethical creation, into which husbands and wives,
parents and children, masters and servants, have here come by their
common Christian character and profession. All depends on their
having power to know and honor the fact of their own heavenly
distinction in this view, so as to ‘⁶ walk worthy of the vocation where-
with they are called.’' Children, we see, as well as others, have place
in this glorious citizenship of the saintS, however we may suppose
them to have come into it3 and being there, they are to be known,
and also to know themselves, as being “in Christ ’' no less than their
believing parentS, and not simply as being candidates for the Christian
profession at some future time. They come in, with other classes, for
their full proportion of Apostolic counsel and care, subject to no dismal
exclusion whatever from the membership of Christ⁷s Church. They are
exhorted to obey their parents “in the Lord⁷' (Eph. 6: 1; Col. 3:
20) ; which implies, of course, that they are “not strangers and
foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of
faith;’⁷ and it is charged upon fathers (Eph. 6: 43 Col. 3: 21) to
treat them—not as children of the Devil-—but as children of God, by
reverencing their tender personality, and bringing them up “in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord.”
