HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 7 7

God’s Spirit, that they become in their right outward use actual
vehicles of it to the inward appropriation of saith. What is thus
communicated to the believer, moreover, is not simply the merits of
Christ, the benefits He has procured for us by His death, but Christ
Himself, His “ person, substance, and being,” through which alone, it is
said, we can have any part in such benefits and meritS. This mystical
