lished or uniform method3 the result of which was much confusion
and deficiency of sound religious views. There could be, however,
“no steady maintenance of either Christian or worldly office, govern-
ment and administration, also no increase and growth of 'sobriety,
honesty, and all other good virtueS, unless the young, above all things,
were kept and held from the start to the pure learning of the holy
Gospel, and the right knowledge of God, in some fixed and settled
form.’' He had considered it, therefore, the first duty of his Govern-
ment, to make provision for this most necessary object. And so now,
accordingly, he proceeds to say, “with counsel and cooperation of our
whole theological faculty, here present, as well as of all the superin-
tendents and leading ministers of the Church, we have caused to be
made and set forth, both in the German and Latin tongues, a Sammary
Inctructiooz, or Gatechism, of our Christian religion from the Word of
God3 in order that henceforth not· only the youth may be piously
trained and kept to such doctrine in the same form, but that the
preachers and schoolmasters also may themselves have a sure standing
rule and measure, how to conduct themselves in the instruction of the
young, and not presume to make daily changes, or to bring in strange
doctrine, at their own pleasure. This same Catechism, then, ye are
all and every one of you graciously exhorted and commanded, for the
honor of God and our subjects, as also for the advantage and good of
your own souls, thankffully to receive; also to inculcate it diligently
and well, according to its true sense, on the young in churches and
schools, as likewise on the people generally from the pulpit 3 to teach,
work, and live according to it, with the full hope and confidence that
if the young be thus taught and brought up with earnestness in the
Word of God, the Almighty will grant unto us also a bettering of life, , ’
with temporal and eterna] prosperity.” s
