the Lord’s Supper and the Roman Mass. The difference in these
copies is, that in some the closing malediction appears in full, as it
now stands, whereas in others it lacks the clause, “ ancl an accurscd
idolatryss’ stopping short with the words which go before. Connecting
this variation with what is said of the “ oversight ’⁷ of a previous
print, we do seem indeed at first sight to have three different editions
of the Catechism.

that the change in question was made while this edition was going
through the press, so as to make a difference in the copies. Van
