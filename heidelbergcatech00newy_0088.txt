78 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

tions by the power of the Holy Ghost; actus in actu thus, the
working of the spirit in His own sphere going along with the sacra-
mental ministration in the sphere of nature, and filling out the true
and proper sense of it in another order of existence altogether. In
this view the fact of the Saviour's glorified body being in heaven only,
and not on the earth, is considered to be no bar at all to the idea οξ
3 real communion with it in the sacrament. It can seem so only
to those whose minds are so preoccupied with the notion of local and
physica] connection, that they have no power to rise to the far higher
conception of a true dynamical connection through the Spirit. Even
in the sphere of nature, there are what may be called physica] unions
of things locally separate and distinct, which far exceed in intimacy
and closeness all merely local contact or inbeing. Such is the union
of the vine with its branches, and the union of the head with the
members οξ the human body.; which are especially employed in the
New Testament to represent the very mystery of which we are now
speaking, the communication of Christ’s life to His people. Why
then should it be thought a thing impossible for this to have place
in the sacrament, so that, although “Christ is in heaven and we on
the earth,'⁷ we may nevertheless come into communion there with His
blessed body itself, through the working of the Holy Ghost‚ in a way
surpassing all natural understandingZ “The ascension οξ Christ into
heaven,⁷' the theologians of Heidelberg, with Ursinus at their head,
here tell us, “leaves His body indeed in the Holy Supper, but not in
the bread3 for the Holy Ghost, by whose power and working things
far asunder as regards place are as closely bound and joined as though
they were together in the same place, unites and binds us, who are on
the earth, with the body of Christ which is in heaven, a thousand
times more closely and firmly than the members of our body are
