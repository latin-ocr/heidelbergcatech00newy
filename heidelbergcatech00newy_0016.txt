8 PREFACE.

Creed, as it stands in the Heidelberg catechism, being a translation of the form of
saith which comes down to us from the primitive Church through the medium of
the Greek and Latin language, this translation is a proper subject of ”criticism and
review. The meaning of words, in the course of time, is modified and changed.
The term hell no longer conveys the old sense unequivocally. It has, therefore,
after much reflection, been dropped. Hades is substituted, because it is the original
word, and expresses more fully and definitely the idea of the Creed. A correspond-
ing change has been introduced into the Modern German text.

The Scripture references have all been verified, and the errors, occurring in Nie-
meyer's edition, corrected.

The different parts of the work were each, at first, referred for preparation to a
sub-committee, composed of one or two members, who afterwards reported the re-
sults of their labor to the entire Committee, which held meetings from time to time,
and subjected these reports to a critical and thorough revision. Whilst, therefore,
the different parts emanate originally from particular individuals, the work in its
final form, as now issued‚ is properly the joint product of the Committee as a whole.

No time nor labor has been spared in the endeavor to discharge properly the
important trust of Synod ; yet we do not presume that the work is faultless. As it
is, however, we commit it to the Church‚ in the hope that it may advance and
extend the knowledge of the Reformed faith, and hand down the principa] Confes-
sion of the Reformed Church to coming generations, with new affection and honor.

The Committee is composed of the following members: Ε. V. Gerhart, D. D.;
John W. Nevin, D.D.; Henry Harbaugh, D. D.; John S. Kessler, D. D.; Daniel
Zacharias, D. D. 3 William Heyser, Esq. ; Rudolph F. Kelker, Esq. 3 and Lewis H.
Steiner‚ M. D.
