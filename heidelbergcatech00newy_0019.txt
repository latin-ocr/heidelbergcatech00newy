HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

MONG the symbolical books of the Evangelical Reformed
Church‚ there is no one which is more entitled to consideration
than the HEIDELBERG CATECHISM. Whether we look at its character or
its history, it must be allowed to be of central significance for the
general confessional interest to which it belongs. Nowhere else have
we the proper genius and life of the Reformed Church‚ as it stood in ·
the latter half of the sixteenth century, exhibited and portrayed in
the same happily comprehensive form. No formulary has entered more
largely into the inward history of this Church as a whole; none has
better claims to be considered of ecumenical authority for its saith.

In order that we may properly understand its merits, it is necessary
for us, first of all, to consider its origin, as conditioned by the circum-
stances under which it was ushered into the world. This requires
that we should first glance at the ecclesiastical state of the Palatinate
at the time, and then notice more particularly the personal figures that
are seen to move conspicuously in the work of its preparation.
