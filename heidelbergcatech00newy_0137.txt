HISTORICAL IN TRODUOTION . 1 2 7 ‚Å¥

Altogether, the German and Dutch Reformed Churches in this
country have good reason to glory in their common symbol, and to
cling to it with abiding affection as the most precious heirloom of
their denominational existence. Though not for them here the palla-
dium of civil and political rights, as it has been in times past for
Churches in other lands, it is still the charter and warrant of their
proper ecclesiastica] constitution, without which they can have no
right to continue their existence as particular Churches at all. They
owe it to the world, as well as to themselves, to remain confessionally
and ecclesiastically true to their own historica] life3 and they can
claim for themselves no more honorable distinction, in the Christian
Commonwealth, than to be known and spoken of as the CHUROHES OF
THE HEIDELBERG CATEOHISM.
