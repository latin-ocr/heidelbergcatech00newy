- 75 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

We can have no better authority or evidence on this subject than
the formal defence of the sacramental doctrine of the Oatechism,
which was drawn up by Ursinus himself, at the request of the Elector
F rederick, and published March, 1564, in the name of the whole
theologica] faculty of Heidelberg, for the very purpose of setting
before the world the true position of the Palatinate with regard to

power of the Holy Ghost, the medium and organ of its communication
at the time. They are not themselves the gift 3 they have no power
in themselves to produce it3 but still they are so bound to itin the
way of certification and pledge, by the wonder-working power of
