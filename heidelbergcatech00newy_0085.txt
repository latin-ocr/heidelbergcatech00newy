HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION. 7 5

and clearly before our minds, in order that we may not fall into the
mistake, on the other side, of lowering its sense to the measure of
wholly different relations. To deny the allenthctlbenkez't (everywhere-
ness) of Christ’s glorified body, and so to reject the notion of its 10001

comprehension in the sacramenta] elements, did not amount by any · ι

means, in the sixteenth century, as for many it might seem to do now,
to a denia] of the objective working of His human bodily life in the
sacrament, in any and every way. Clearly the Catechism could mean
no such radica] negation as that; for this would have been to turn
into something worse than folly its professed relations to the Lutheran
Church, as well as the whole ubiquitarian controversy itself, so ear-
nestly carried on by its friends, for years, with the theologians of

> Ti'ibingen. As we have seen before, the Catechism was not intended,

in the beginning, to be a rupture in full with the German Lutheran

yx„

Church. It was supposed to be in harmony with the Confession of Ι

Augsburg, as explained by Melancthon himself. In its sacramenta]
doctrine, therefore, it was held to come fairly within the range of the
tenth article of that Confession in its changed for1n3 which, it will be
remembered, differs from its original form, only in not making the
communication of Christ’s body and blood in the sacrament to be in
and under the elements, while it is still declared to go along with
them, as part of the transaction, in the most real way. The mystery
of the fact itself remains as a necessary article of faith3 only the
question of the mode or manner of it 10 left without any sort of
determination. In this view, unquestionably, the doctrine of Melanc-
thon here must be considered the doctrine also of the Heidelberg
Catechism. So far as the fact of the sacramenta] mystery is concerned,
the last was supposed at least to mean all that was required by the
first.
