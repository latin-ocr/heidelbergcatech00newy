mind in their confessional vieWS. There was a material difference, in
the beginning, between the Zuinglian and the Calvinistic types of
doctrine. Calvin’s doctrine of the decrees again was not received
everywhere in the same form3 and with the course of time, especially,
the relation between this and the doctrine of the sacraments became

the whole form and structure of theological thought. We can easily
see, that there was a difference in this way between the Helvetic
Church and the Gallicam that neither of these were just the same
with the Belgic; and that the Scotch Church again had its own
national peculiarities, distinguishing it in a very marked manner from

Christianity, than which, as there is no symbol more largely catholic,
so is there none also more positive and vitally fundamental to all true
