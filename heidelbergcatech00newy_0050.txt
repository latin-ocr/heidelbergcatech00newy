42 HISTORIGAL INTRODUOTION.

But care was taken, at the same time, that the work of the pulpit
in this form should be properly supported by a corresponding work
of the school. The whole business of education, from the mother's
knee up to the theological chair of the university, must be so
ordered as to have its religious basis throughout in the Catechism.
The school teachers were in fact part of the eeclesiastical establishment
of the land; and' it was their province in particular to see that the
young were diligently trained in the knowledge of the Catechism from
the beginning, so as to be qualified in due time for a full religious
profession. Then the ministers themselves must have their minds cast
into it as a mould of doctrine, by its being made a prominent part of
their theological education. Thus it was that Ursinus himself, imme-
diately after the publication of the Catechism, commenced a course of
lectures upon it in the Sapienz-college3 which he continued then to

, repeat yearly till as late as 1577. Notes of these lectureS, taken by

different hands, were given after his death to the public; but it soon
appeared that they were not in such a form at all as to do justice to
his memory; whereupon the celebrated David Parcus, one of his
most distinguished disciples, was requested to review and revise the
material, and to put the whole into what he might consider worthy
and suitable shape. In this way was brought to pass the work which
has been handed down, with much commendation, to later times, as the
Commentary of Ursinus on the Heidelberg Catechism. Its true and
proper authorship belongs largely, it would appear, to David Pareus.
