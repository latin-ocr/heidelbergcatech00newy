it must always be assumed, of course, that they are not such in fact,
but require only a deeper knowledge than we now have, to be seen in
their proper concord and agreement. All great truths indeed, it has
been said, are polar 3 carry in themselves opposing forces or powers,
whose very contradiction is found to be necessary at last to the true
harmony of their constitution.
