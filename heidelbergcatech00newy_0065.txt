HISTORICAL IN TRODUCTION . 57

which for a time threatened to overthrow the Reformed Church of the
Palatinate altogether.

In the year 1719, during the reign of Okarles Philip, some book-
seller, a Catholic, who was authorized to print Protestant books, had
allowed himself to publish an edition of the Heidelberg Catechism, to
which was in'considerately prefixed the Elector’s coat of arms, with the
words underneath: By authority of his E Zectoral Serene Hiqhness.
This roused the Romanists to a perfect tempest of fanatical zeal. The
Prince, mildly enough disposed himself, was so urged and pressed from
all sides, that he found it impossible to withstand the tumult 3 and so
finally a decree appeared, in his name, requiring the entire suppression
of this edition, and forbidding thenceforward the use of any copies of
the Catechism that should contain the 80th question. This was a blow
aimed at the very existence of the Catechism3 and through it at the
life of the Reformed Church, of whose confessional rights in the State
it was the acknowledged symbol and pledge.

As a matter of course, this tyrannica] measure called forth loud
remonstrance and complaint. Foreign powers also—England, Prussia,
the States Genera] of Holland and West Friesland, and some of the
Reformed German Principalities——were moved to interfere, partly by
letter and partly by embassy, earnestly demanding that their oppressed
brethren of the Reformed faith might have their rights restored to
them in the free use of their Catechism, Altogether there was much
discussion, argument, and diplomatic negotiation; the end of which
was, however, that the Elector found it necessary to recede from the
high ground he had taken, and to revoke his offensive decree the very
next year after it was issued. Under certain general conditions, for
the sake of form and to save appearances, it was' declared that the
restriction on the printing of the Heidelberg Catechism was removed,
