HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION. 97

gloss, for example, on the descent to hades, adopted in the 44th
question from Calvin. But with all this, there is a real inward corre·
spondence between the Catechism and the Creed, which in the circum-
stances is truly remarkable. The Creed is here not simply as an
outward text, made to accommodate itself to the purposes of religious
instruction in one part of the Catechism ; but as the central basis
rather of the whole work, in which all its parts come together and
find their true construction and sense. However it may have come to
pass, the fundamental idea of the Catechism, the scheme on which it
is projected, leads over of itself to the “articles of our catholic, un-
doubted Christian faith,’⁷ as they are presented to us in the Creed;
the exposition of which then follows, in the second part, as a simple
history of the great work of redemption, carrying forward with natural
ease the general theme proposed in the first question. The spirit of
the Creed, in this way, seems to enter into the whole constitution of
the work, influencing its course of thought, and giving form and
complexion to its conceptions, even beyond what was designed always
or distinctly premeditated in the mind of its authors. For it is not
too much to say, that in the composition of the Catechism we have
something more than mere outward thought and reflection. It carries
in it, unquestionably, to some extent, the genia] inspiration of a true
work of art ; in which the mind of the artist is seized and borne away
by what we may call the mind of his subject, so as to become for it
the more or less passive organ simply of its own self·production.
Only in such view can we account for much, that must otherwise ever
appear strange and perplexing in the authorship of the book.
