HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTmN. 87

defections, in the case of believers, as shall completely eclipse, while
they last, any assurance they may have had before of the certainty
of their own salvation. This of itself then is sufficient to show, that
the mere confidence of saith, however just, is not at once a conclusive
argument for the continuation of its own present good estate unto the
end3 and so the strong language of the Catechism in regard to this
confidence may agree very well, after all, with the supposition that
there is such a thing as falling away hopelessly from a state of grace.
The ark may include all that Ais necessary to outride the flood, and
land its rescued ones on Ararat in the end ; and they may have, while

or settle.

i Here then is a material difference between the Heidelberg Cate-
chism and many of the larger Confessions of Faith which have
appeared in the Reformed Church. It may be said indeed, that the
