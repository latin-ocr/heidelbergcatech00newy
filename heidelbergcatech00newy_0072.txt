64 HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION.

Amsterdam. In the year 1568,111 a general Synod held at Wesel it
was recommended, that in the French churches of the Netherlands the
Catechism of Gen‘eva (Calvin’s) should continue to be employed, and
that where the Dutch language prevailed use should be made of the
Heidelberg Catechism. The Synod of Emden in 1571 renewed this
recommendation in somewhat stronger terms. Finally the Synod
held at Dort in 1574 changed the advice into a decree, making the
Heidelberg Catechism thus to be of full symbolica] authority for the
whole Dutch Reformed Church. Soon after this we find it required,
that the ministers should everywhere preach upon it on Sunday
afternoons, so as to go over the whole of it once a year. Then it was
made a rule, that ministers and schoolmasters, as well as professors
of theology, should bind themselves, by a solemn subscription of their
names, to be governed by it in all their religious teaching. The city
of Gouda in South Holland undertook, some time after, to introduce
a new compend of religious instruction into its schools. But the
ministers of the place were called to account, and publicly censured
for the attempt. Indifference to the Heidelberg Catechism, was
considered to be disaffection to the proper orthodoxy of the Reformed
Church. So entirely identified did it become in this way with the
reigning religious life of the Netherlands, that it was known and
spoken of at last simply as the Belgio Catechism.

Here again, however, the Catechism had its enemies, as in other
lands. The Romanists stigmatized it as a public pest3 and to show
their hatred toward it, would publicly burn it at times or whip it
with rods3 while argument and wit were employed also to bring it -
into contempt. There was opposition to it besides, however, from a
different quarter. As it pleased not the high-toned Lutheranism of
Germany, so it suited not the low-toned Arminianism of Holland.
