HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 65

Arminius himself professed to be satisfied in the main with its
doctrines; but he had difficulties with it again in regard to several
points, and wished there might be a revision of it, to remove its
objectionable features. After his death, his friends, the Remonstrants,
as they were called, continued to talk in the same style. They found
much in the Catechism that called for correction. It had been
introduced too hastily into the Church, they thought, and without
proper examination of its merits. They were not willing to have it
read and preached upon in the pulpits, as though it were part of

itself. The result of all, as is generally known, was the condemnation
of the views held by the Arminian party, and their exclusion from the
bosom of the Reformed Church.

Along with this a solemn judgment was passed in favor of the

over and considered, so as to have the opinion of each delegate taken
in regard to its merits. This was done in form 3 and the result was,
we are told, a full and unanimous approval of the Catechism as it
stood, which was then embodied in the following memorable declara-
tion: “That in the united judgment of all the theologians present,
