HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION. 35

the preparation of the Catechism went to work, accordingly, with a
haste which seemecl hardly compatible with the solemnity and great-
ness of their undertaking. The joint composition of the book, which
we have found to be so surprising in any view, becomes in these
circumstances still more strange3 since it would appear to have been
not so much the result of long deliberation and care, as a sort of genial
inspiration rather, moving immediately and directly to its end3 a thing
truly wonderful, as involving here not a single mind only, but two
minds of such different make and type.

We must not, however, fall into the error of supposing, on the
other hand, that the free spontaneous production of the Catechism, in
this way, went forward in purely subjective style, without study and
the proper use of previously existing material ancl help. We know
the reverse of this to have been true. Full regard was had to older
Catechisms, especially such as had appeared in different parts of the
Reformed Church3 and it is very easy to trace in the new formulary
the influence in particular of Calvin's Catechism, and of that composed
by the celebrated Lasky. In the way of preparation for their joint
work, moreover, each of the two fellow-laborers put his hand in the
first place to a separate private composition in catechetical form:
Olevianus, in a free, popular sketch, framed on his favorite idea of the
Covenant of GraceÍ¾ Ursinus in a twofold, larger and smaller, Cate-
chesis, setting forth the rudiments of the Christian religion. Out of
such learning and diligent study grew forth in the end the Heidelberg
Catechism as we have it n0w3 and yet, with all this, it is no compila-
tion simply from these sources. It cannot be said to be outwardly
taken even from the preliminary separate productioris of its own
authors, as little as it shows itself to have been borrowed in any such
outward way from the Catechisms of Lasky and Calvin. Full use is
