6 PREFAOE.

The English text is a new translation. The oldest English version is from the
Latin, by Dr. Henry Parry, Bishop of Worcester, and was first published at Oxford,
in 1591. Of this version there is a revision,* on the basis also of the Latin, which we
have been able to trace as far back as the year 1728 ; but cannot ascertam by whom
the revision, which varies from Parry’s version in many places, was executed, or
when it was first published.

The received translation, now in use in the American German and Dutch Re-
for'med Churches‚ is a different work, and was probably made originally in Holland
during the early part of the last century, but when precisely, or by whom, is not
known. In point of fidelity to the original and general merit, it is greatly superior
to previous translations 3 but, like its predecessors, the text is not based on the Ger-
man. The language throughout is governed mainly by the Latin 3 and the work
must be a translation either of the Latin or of the Dutch version. As the result of
a careful comparison, we discover that whenever the received text adopts a word or
clause that does not stand either in the German or Latin, the same word or clause is
found in the Dutch version3 and, on the contrary, when a clause, contained both in
the German and Latin, is omitted in the Dutch version, the same clause is omitted
in the received English text. Though the received English text in some places
departs from the Latin and follows the German, this fact appears to be no evidence
that the translation was modified by reference to the German ; for in these instances
the Dutch version also departs from the Latin and follows the German. The most
probable opinion, therefore, sustained by internal evidence, is that this English text
is a translation from the Dutch version ; and that the Dutch version is a translation
of the Latin, modified by comparison with the original German, and by certain addi-
tions and omissions, which, in the absence of any historical authority, may be justly
attributed to the Dutch translator.†

When, early in 17 64, English preaching was first introduced into the Dutch
Church‚ by the settlement at Flushing of Dr. Laidlie, originally from Scotland‚ the
Consistory resolved at once to prepare 'and publish in English a book of Psalms set
to music, the Confession of F aith, the Catechism, and Liturgy; and, in May of that

’ὲ Parry's version and the revision are both reprinted in the “Mercersburg Review‚” vol. xiii, 1861,
pp. 71-133.

† The Dutch version is attributed to Rev. Peter Dathenus‚ and was first published in 1566. See an
article in the Tercentenary Monument‚ by the Rev. Dr. G. D. J. Schotel, p. 158.
