Are infant& also to be baptized ,9

ANSWER.

Yes. For since they, as well as
their parents, belong to the eove-
nant and people of God, and both
redemption from sin and the Holy
Ghost, Who works saith, are through
the blood of Christ promised. to

them no less than to their parents;

they are also by Baptism, as a sign
of the covenan'c, to be ingrasted
into the Christian Chureh‚ and dis-
tinguished from the children of
unbelievers‚ as was done in the
Old Testament by Circumcision,-in
place of which in the NeW Testa&
ment Baptism is appointed.
