HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION. 111

through the power of the life which is supposed to belong to them in
common with their teachers. In other ¹words⁷ it will be organic,
reproductive, the continuous ongoing, we may say, of the “law of the
spirit of life in Christ J esus.’' For any such process the idea of the
Church is indispensable ; for with this only can we have the superna-
tural element-—in distinction from the element of mere nature—in
which it may be felt possible at all for the work of the Spirit to
proceed in such manner. To be brought up and educated in the Lord
is to be first planted in the life of the Church3 and then to be so
comprehended in this, and so nurtured by it from the beginning, in
the trustful use of all its means of grace and salvation, that the sou]
shall have the sense of it formed into itself as part of its own con-
sciousness, and grow up in it always as the natural home and habit
of its thoughts ; just as in the order of nature, the life of a family, or
the constitutional spirit of a whole people, is found to pass onward
from one generation to another in the same organic way.

This does not imply, by any means, that such covenant relation-
ship to God involves of itself a natural, spontaneous growing up into
the-maturity of the Christian life, without obstacle or let, and with no
farther care, from the beginning. There must be, of course, the proper
conditions of outward Christian training—the vivifying action of
spiritual light, and air, and heat, in the family and in the Church—
and the proper inward disposition of obedience and faith also on the
part of the subject, (come whence or how it may), to secure any such
result as that3 and as these terms of success are in general only most
imperfectly at hand in the actual state and character of the Christian
world, it need be no matter of surprise that the grace of God, in the
form of which we are now speaking, should seem to be bestowed upon
very many altogether in vain ; or that where this may not be the case,
