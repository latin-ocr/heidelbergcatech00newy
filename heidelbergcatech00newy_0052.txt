44 HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION.

he looked to him for counsel and advice. He brought in a new Cate-
chism; but he did not intend, in doing SO, to renounce his allegiance
to the Augsburg Confession. He had no difficulty in subscribing to it
afterward, as he had subscribed to it before. Why should his Calvin-
istic sympathies and tendencies be considered any bar to that, when
it was known that Calvin himself had been willing to accept it in
the same way without any hesitation? Then as to the authors
of the Catechism. They were indeed in open correspondence and
fellowship with the leaders of the Reformed Church in Switzerland.
But they had not renounced certainly their interest, by birth and
education, in the Protestantism of Germany. Ursinus had been one

it should be full only of friendship and peace.

But it was not easy, or rather we may say, it was altogether im-

finding an apology for it with Melancthon, or Melancthon's school.
If this might be considered in any sense the natural issue and end of
Melancthonianism, let the abettors of that system now look to it, and
