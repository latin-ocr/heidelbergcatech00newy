7 2 HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION.

Christian saith. Only so can we understand, how it should have
happened 10 the Heidelberg Catechism, above all other Catechisms and
Confessions, to acquire and keep for itself as it has done the ecumenical
credit, which has all along been allowed 10 11 in the history of the

form. Even its antagonism to the Roman Catholic Church, if we
