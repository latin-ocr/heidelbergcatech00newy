Reference may be made properly, also, to J. W. N EVIN’s History and Genius of
the Heidelbery Cateelzism, published at Chambersburg, Pa„ in 1847.

The Catechism, as given in the first column, is the original text, the ipsissima
verba of the third edition of 1563. Failing in our endeavor to obtain, in Europe, a
copy of the editio princeps, we have had recourse to the work of Dr. Η. Α. Ν10-
meyer, entitled, Collectio Cmffessionum in Eeclesiis Reformatis Publieatarum,
which furnishes the text as originally issued. We reprint it word for word, and
letter for letter 3 with three exceptions. We insert, as being evidently necessary to
complete the grammatical construction, the word “ ich ⁷’ after “Dasz” in the first
line of the fifty-second answer, so as to read: Dasz ich in allem Trtibsal3 and the
word ‘⁶ wil ’' before “ lehren,'' in the second line of the seventy-third answer, so as
to read: Nit allein dz er vns damit wil lehren. We depart also from Niemeyer, by
putting in brackets the memorable addition to the eightieth answer, to indicate that,
whilst it belongs to the Catechism as approved by the Elector, Frederick the Pious,
as received by the Church of the Palatinate, and publishcd in the third edition, it
is neverthcless 7206 a part of the original Catechism as completed by the authors, as
first adopted by the Synod of the Palatinate, and published in the first edition,
which was accompanied by the celebrated proclamation of the Elector, under date
of the 19th of J anuary, 15633 and that therefore, although authentic, it possesses
less ecclesiastica] authority than the other portions of the answe1·.* For the same
general reason, we repeat the brackets in the other columns.

This original text is the ultimate standard of the Catechism. It is the norm by
Which all subsequent editions in German, and all translations into other languages,
are to be judged. As such the Committee have regarded it 3 and have consequently
omitted in the Modern German text and in the English translation, as being without
authority, all words and phrases which have been added in the Latin and introduced
into later German editions, but are not warranted by the German edition of 1563.

The Latin is the translation made by J oshua Lagus and Lambertus Pithopoeus,

the Rev. Dr. C. Unmmn, in the Tercenteuary sssomcment, pp. 130-135.
