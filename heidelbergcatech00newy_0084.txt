7 4 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

Godhead is incomprehensible and everywhere present, it must follow
that it is indeed beyond the bounds of the Manhood which it has 68-
„ sumed, but is yet none the less in the same 6180, and remains personal-
ly united to it.'’ This of course, then, conditions again the view that
is taken of our communion with the Saviour in the Lord’s Supper3
which holds good, we are told qu. ’7 6, “ though Christ is in heaven

the discussion was occupied for five days with the subject of Christ's
glorification and omnipresence in the world, coming only on the sixth
and last day to the question of His presence in the Holy Eucharist.
Then we have the same controversy—“ infelix bellum ubiquitarium
et sacramentarium ’'——kept up for years through the press. Finally,
the Form of Concord came out3 and the last great publication of
Ursinus, as we have 86611, was his Christian Admonition in reply,
which was held by many to be the ablest work that the whole
controversy had produced.

There is no room for any mistake, thus, with regard to the
sacramenta] and Christological teaching of the Heidelberg Catechism,
so far as antagonism to Lutheran theology in this form is concerned.
But we need to have this main issue, as it stood at the time, distinctly
