1 1 8 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

covenant rights and privileges3 baptismal grace, and the sanctification
of children to the service of God in this way, as truly as if Christ had
laid His hands upon them, and blessed them for such purpose. This,
we say, was the reigning belief ; and because it was so, the age
addressed itself vigorously everywhere, as we have seen, to the work
of educational religion, aiming to build in such style on the foundation
which was supposed to be at hand in the established order of the
Church. Hence the full and universal subordination of the school to
the sanctuary. Hence the significance of the Catechism, as an organ
of Christian instruction. Hence the catechetical system, in all its
ramifications of discipline, whether private or publio, kept up con-

of the year to the other.

We are surrounded now, as we have just seen, with a wholly
different practice, which is the fruit and evidence also of a wholly
different faith. What that faith is, or rather what it is not, has been
mentioned already in general terms. lt is the absence of all belief in
that side of Christianity, which is represented to us in the idea of the
Church, as being in any way the organ and medium of grace for the
children of men. In this respect, our modern sects generally are of
one mind. Calling themselves evangelical, and profess-ing to be
wholly governed by the Bible, they yet shut their eyes systematically
to the plain sense of half the New Testament, and turn into'a nullity
every part of it that owns the fact of sacramenta] grace, or makes
account of outward covenant interest in Christ. They will have it
that there is no such covenant, other than that into which the world
at large is brought, by the death of Christ, and by the free offer of salva·
tion now in His name. They are all of them thus constitutionally·
