HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION. 39

track 3 seeming to think that the 80th question was at first dropped
from the manuscript as originally prepared, through fear of giving
offence, but that the Elector came afterward to have more courage,
and ordered it to be printed3 though it needed still a third edition, it
would seem then, to bring him fairly up to the point of rounding it
off as it now stands The late work of Sudhoff also on Olevianus
and Ursinus, strange to say, repeats the old mistake.

But 11118 whole difficulty with the first issue of the Catechism is
known now to be imaginary and gratuitous. Copies are still extant

different phases of the 80111 question, and so three different impressions
in fact of the Catechism. Kocher’s conjecture in regard to the second
variation, then, may be easily applied also to the first, and offers us no
doubt the true key for the proper explanation of the whole matter.
The three impressions are in fact so many varieties only of one and

passing through the press, so as to give the addition 10 1110 80111
question, first in part, and then in full as it now stands. The addi-
tion belongs of course to the Elector3 and the reason which has been
assigned for it is in all probability correct, the provocation namely
with which he was affected, on hearing of the anathemas which the
