HISTORIOAL INTRODUGTION. 41

constantly and diligently in their work. The new Kirchenordnung of
1563 was so framed as to make it an integral part, the very ground
and basis we may say, of the whole church system of the Palatinate.

The pulpit must be bound by it as a perpetual directory and rule.
Preaching was to be indeed from the Bible, the only sufficient standard
in the end of faith and practice ; but it must be from the Bible, at the
same time, in the sense of the Catechism, and care must be taken to
quote and bring in the language of the Catechism, to enforce and
support the preaching, as well as to make the formulary itself honor-
able in the eyes of the people. In any case, moreover, the pastors of
the Palatinate were not to have general liberty to preach from any
part of the Bible, at their own pleasure 3 for how was it to be supposed
that they could all use ‘such freedom to proper edificationZ They
must keep themselves to such parts as were sanctioned and ordered by
the inspectors or superintendents of the ecclesiastical districts to which
they belonged, whose province it was to see that the true interests of
the people were rightly consulted in the matter. Then the Catecfflsm,
besides, must be formally read before the people from the pulpit, a
prescribed section or lesson on each Sunday, as part of the morning
service, so as to go over the whole of it once every ten weeks. To
crown all, an afternoon service was established for the sole object of
expounding and enforcing its instructions. For this purpose it was
divided into fifty-two SundayS, or parts, on each one of which the
minister was to preach in succession, until 116 had gone, in this way,
during the course of the year, over the whole book. Catechetical
preaching became thus a general standing institution for the Palatinate.
It is easy to see what force it must have carried with it, to clothe the
Gatechism with authority and power, and to make it the reigning
measure of religious thought for the land. '
