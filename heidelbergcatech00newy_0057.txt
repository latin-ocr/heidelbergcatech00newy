HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION. 49

to all believers, that what he might lose for his name in this life
should be restored to him a hundred fold in the next.

This bold and manly address made a deep impression upon the
assembly. All were constrained to admire the Elector’s earnestness,
and his truly heroic spirit. Augustus of Saxony was so moved, that
he came up to him, and exclaimed, touching him lightly on the
shoulder: ‘⁶ F rederick, you are more religious than all of us together 1⁷⁷
The Margrave of Baden also, as the convention was breaking up,
remarked to some of the Princes: “Why do ye trouble this man?
He has more piety than the whole of us 1’⁷

It was in fact a signal victory over all the plans and expectations
of his enemieS. It was felt among the Protestant Princes, that things
were in danger of being carried too far3 and when it came to a vote
on the subject, accordingly, it was found to be the sense of the diet
finally, in opposition to the judgment of the Emperor, that the Elector
of the Palatinate was still to be regarded and treated as belonging to
the alliance of the Augsburg Confession. In this way, the attempt to
arm the politica] power of the Empire against the Heidelberg Cate-
chism proved a complete failure.

The Elector returned to Heidelberg, safe and sound, amidst the
general joy of his people, on the Friday before Whitsuntide. On the
evening before the sacred festival, being present at the preparation
for the communion in the church of the Holy Ghost, he grasped
Olevianus by the hand in view of the whole congregation, and
exhorted him to continue steadfast in the good cause. The next day
he partook of the sacrament, in company with his son Casimir and the
whole court.
