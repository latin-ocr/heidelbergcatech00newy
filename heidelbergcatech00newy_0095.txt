HISTORICAL INTRODUOTION. 8 5

racc—which is after 311 the only really consistent form of metaphysical
¹ Calvinism 3 but the whole doctrine of the decrees is left untouched,
except as it may seem to be comprised in the doctrine of God's
almighty and everywhere present providence. The idea of predestina-
tion to life is brought no closer than this : that of the fallen posterity
of Adam those only are saved by Christ, who “by true faith are
ingrafted into Him, and receive all His benefits ’⁷ (qu. 20) 3 or that the
Son of Grod gathers and preserves for Himself, out of the whole human

here of all difficultieS, and true to all sound religious feeling, it plainly
declares, in conformity with the unequivocal sense of the Scriptures
themselves, that Christ “ bore, in body and soul, the wrath of God
against the sin of the whole human race '’ (qu, 37) 3 which is of course
implied also in what is asserted before of its being necessary for Him
to be very man, in order that the “same human nature '’ which sinned
in Adam, might in Him again, as the new Adam, “make satisfaction
for sin,’' and so “obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life ‘’
(qu. 16, 17).

So also if the question be asked, whether God's grace be irresist-
