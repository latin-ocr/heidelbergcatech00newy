QUEsrroN 81.

Who are to come unto the table
of the Lord ?

ANSWER.

Those vvho are displeased With
themselves for their sins, yet trust
that these are forgiven them, and ’Ὗ
that their remaining infirmity is ¹
covered by the passion and death
of Christ3 who also desire more
and more to strengthen their faith
But the im-
penitent and hypocrites eat and
drink judgment to themselves.

and amend their life.

QUESTION 82.

Are they then also to be admitted
to this quffier, who show themselves
to be, by their confession and Zffe,
unbelz'evinq and quodly ?

ANSWER.

No: for by this the covenant
of God is profaned‚ and His wrath
provoked against the whole con-
gregation; Wherefore the Christian
Church is bound, according to the
order of Christ and His Apostles,
by the office of the keys to exclude
such persons‚' until they amend
their life.
