Τᾘθ literature of the Catechism includes besides a number of works
founded upon it, or suggested by it in various ways3 different abbrevi-
ations of it, in the way of extract or summary, for ⁴common plain use ;
and what must not be omitted, various paraphrases of it also, more or
less full, in verse and rhyme. Thus we have, as early as 1597, Pincer's
“ Paraphrasis,'' and afterward Plante's “Epigrammata Sacra,’' both
written, upon it in Latin verse. Christian Klaarbout brought it out at
Amsterdam, 1725, question and answer, in full Dutch metre, under the
sounding title ε “The Lustre of the Reformed Church, Shining forth in
a brief Srimmary of Sacred Divinity from the Heidelberg Catechism.''
We read also of other attempts to do it honor in the same way.

So far we have been looking only at the countries of Europe. The
Heidelberg Catechism, however, has not held itself to these bounds.
With the Dutch colonies, it has gone of course into Asia and Africa;
but what is of far more account, it has crossed the Atlantic, and found
in AMERICA also a new history and a new home.

More than two centuries have now passed, since it was first erected
as a standard of evangelical orthodoxy on the island of Manhattan, Α
where the city of New York has since grown to such vast importance.
Around it rallied the saith of thousands, transplanted through succes-
sive years from the old world to the shores of the new. In the midst
of ecclesiastical convulsions and rude politica] storms, the quormed
Dutch Olaureh of America, clinging fast to her hereditary creed, has
since struck her roots deep into the soil, and spread forth her boughs
luxuriantly to the face of heaven, till she has become known and
honored throughout the whole Christian world. A century later in
origin, the American German quormed Charchr—sprung indeed, in a
certain sense, from the same womb, or at least nursed in the beginning
by the same maternal arms—comes forward also to claim our attention.
