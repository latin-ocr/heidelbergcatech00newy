1 1 6 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

into full communion with the Church, has fallen into neglect or dis-
esteem, and the only safe way of making Christians is supposed to be
that of experimental, subjective excitement and stimulation, on the
outside of these church appliances altogether3 there, most assuredly‚
the old idea of catechetical instruction also will be found to have lost
its meaning, and there will be no longer any power to use a church
Catechism at all in the manner of the sixteenth century. If there be
any semblance left at all of such teaching, it will be only in the milk-
and-water style of such Bible lessons as are made to serve their ephem-
eral purpose in Sunday schools, following no fixed rule, and leaving
behind them no solid indoctrination whatever. It is not possible for
an altogether unchurchly Christianity to 106 6 truly catechetical Christi-
anity, whether this unchurchliness show itself in the pietistic or in the
openly rationalistic form. Socinianism and Anabaptism had indeed
their Catechisms3 but they never entered into the religious life of the
bodies to which they belonged. Arminianism 111 Holland could 1161761·

the Bible, unbound by any formulary of this sort. So in modern
times, we cannot conceive of any vigorous system of catechetical
instruction—in the fashion, for example, which we find reported to
have been common throughout the whole Reformed Church at the
Synod of Dort—as being upheld and prosecuted now among Unitari·
ans, Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, or any of the openly unchurchly
sects that go to make up the mass of our American Christianity.
They move, and have their being, in a wholly different order of
religion. They are, we may say, constitutionally uncatechetical as
well as unchurchly3 and must belie their own existence, should they
think of asserting 01· pe1petuating their life now in any such churchly

way.
