HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 105

What we mean now by all this, is simply to show, that the New
Testament Epistles have the same religious bearing toward those
whom they address, which we have seen to be held by the Heidelberg
Catechism toward its probationers and pupils. In both cases alike,
the teaching is “from saith to faith,” the utterance of Christianity for
the use of such as are supposed to stand within its own sphere. This
would seem to 106 6 sufficient vindication, then, of the peculiar 6011-
struction of the Catechism in this respect. 10 16 not a system of
instruction for unbelievers, and such as are outside of God⁷s 60176116110.
Like the Lord’s Prayer and the Creed, itis for those only who have
been initiated into the life of the Churchj and in putting the full
confession of Christianity into their lips, it cannot be said certainly to
venture more than St. Paul does, when he says (1 Cor. 6: 11) to the Corin-
thian Christians collectively : ‘⁴ Ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are
justified, in the name of the Lord JesuS, and by the Spirit of our
G0d;’' or to go beyond his strong language to the sorely erring
Galatians (Gal. 3 ε 26, 27) : ‘⁴ Ye are all the children of God, by faith
in Christ J esus; for as many of you 66 have been baptized into Christ,
have put on Christ.’'

It will not do to say, of course, that St. Paul's assumption in this
whole case was both for his own mind, and in actual fact, a mere
complimentary 01· benevolent fiction—as when a physician, for example,
tries to inspire his patient with the confidence of returning health,
though knowing him to be under the power of 6 deadly disease. No
one knew better than the Apostle himself, that many of those whom
he addressed as Christians were in a condition of great spiritual
unsoundness and defect; and no one could be more ready to charge γ
home upon them this mournful fact, in the most sweeping and unre-
served terms. But with all this, he never allows himself to question
