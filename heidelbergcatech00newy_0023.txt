fflSTORIOAL INTRODUGTION. 15

sse great sacramental controversy of the sixteenth century includes
in its history two entirely distinct periods. As carried on in the first
place between Luther and the Swiss divineS, with Zuingli, so long as
he lived, at their head, it was brought ostensibly to a close by the
memorable Wittenberg Concord of 1536. This was not considered
absolutely satisfactory, indeed, on either side. But men's minds had
become weary with contention, and it was held desirable at all events
to make the most of a present truce, where it seemed so difficult to
come to avtrue and lasting peace. The result of all, moreover, had
been undoubtedly a partial moderation of extreme views on both sides
It was felt, more widely of course than it was expressed, that Luther
on the one hand, as well as Zuingli on the other, had gone too far3
and that the truth was to be sought in a middle position, rather than
with either of these champions separately considered. Luther himself
probably saw, that the truce involved some feeling of this sort; and
this may have had its influence on the effort, with which he sought
toward the close of his life to have the controversy renewed. The
effort, however, produced no effect. Ten years after the date of the
Concord, A. 1546, he was taken to his rest. The truce still continued.
Many flattered themselves that it had become in fact the grave of all
former theological hostilities. But this expectation was vain. The
general difference of the two confessions had not yet been brought to a
true inward reconciliation3 and the question was too important to be
permanently sacrificed to the interests of any mere prudentia] com·
promise. It might slumber for twenty years; but it could not sleep
always. In due time, accordingly, the truce, as a matter of course,
came to an end. We may find much to quarrel with in the spirit of
those who led the way in the new rupture that followed. But the
rupture itself was necessa-ry. It lay in the religious position of the
