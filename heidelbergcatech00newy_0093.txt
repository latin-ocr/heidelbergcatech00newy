Our spiritual nature, in this way, is in ruins, its powers paralyzed 3
“wholly unapt to any good, and prone to all evil 3 ’' though still under
law, and possessed of a capacity for salvation. If it be asked now,
how this tremendous lapse originally took place, no attempt is made
to fathom the full depth of the mystery. We are only told, in general
terms, that it came not from God, but from the free will of man him-
self. Our first parents were holy, and had power to keep their first
estate 3 they were under no supralapsarian necessity of falling3 but by
their own wilful disobedienoe they fell in fact, and so brought sin and
death upon the entire race (qu, 9). The origin of sin, beyond this, the
Heidelberg Cateohism seeks 1101 10 explain. It rejects all Manichean
necessity on 1116 0116 side, while it rejects also 611 Pelagian freedom
on the other3 and, like the Bible itself, takes 116 6011166 firmly between
these two irreligious extremeS, leaving the understanding to manage
its own embarrassment in the 6666 66 11 1)661 6611. There are 11111116 111

110116, 1101 10 116 reoonciled by the understanding in its common form.
The mind must receive them, if they are 10 106 received at all, through
another sort of knowledge altogether.

What was lost in Adam, the Catechism goes on to teach in the
next place, has been recovered for 116 again, and more than recovered ’
111 Christ. He is the fountain of the whole Christian salvation
(qu. 18), having in 1111116611ἱ 611 1116 qualifications which are needed to
constitute a perfect medium of reconciliation or atonement between
11161111111611 11611116 and the divine (qu, 12-17); being in His own
person in fact the fullest conjunction of both 3 so that “the same
human nature which has sinned” is brought to make full satisfaction
for sin, and to become thus the righteousness of God for the 1666 61
