the Lord⁷s Suppes, but is also eaten therein.”

After all this we can feel no surprise, in finding the last part of
the ‘⁴ Grundlicher Bericht⁷’ devoted to the purpose of showing, that
the Heidelberg doctrine of the Lord’s Supper stood in no opposition
whatever to the tenth article of the Augsburg Confession.

It is easy to recognize here the general sacramental system of
Calvin3 but we have no right to say, that it was borrowed exactly
from Calvin himself. It seems rather to have been reached in an
independent way, as the result of what we have seen to be the
Melancthonian tendency of thought in Germany itself 3 though the
influence of Calvin had something to do also, no doubt, with Ursinus
especially, in determining the particular form of its conception and
expression at certain points. With the merits of the theory we are
not now concerned. Let it pass for what it is worth 3 all we wish is
to have it fairly understood, that this, and no other, is the scheme of
thinking, which underlies the sacramental doctrine of the Heidelberg
Catechism. With all its opposition to the notion of a local presence
of Christ's body in the sacrament, and the thought of everything like
