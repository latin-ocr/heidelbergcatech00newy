82 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTIQN.

destroy its authority and credit3 while the Synod of Dort, speaking
not simply for the Dutch Church, but for the Reformed Confession
in all lands, took it fully into their confidence and trust as a true
exposition of their common faith. It requires, indeed, very little
examination, to perceive that the order of thinking which runs through
the whole work is utterly opposed to the Pelagian scheme in every
form. Nowhere do we find represented in more decided terms, the
helplessness of man, through the fall, on the one hand, and the absolute
sovereignty of God’s grace, in the work of his salvation, on the other.
Thus, as we know, the Catechism has its first part devoted entirely
to the consideration of the misery of man in his fallen state, as some-
thing necessary to be well understood, in order that we may come to
any proper knowledge of our redemption through Christ. It begins,
accordingly, by asserting 111 the strongest manner the general depravity
and corruption of our nature, brought to pass through the wholesale
ruin of the fall. Not only is the fact affirmed, that all men are
involved in the terrible contradiction of sin, (qu. 3-5); but this fact
is referred also to its true ground, as holding, not just in the individua]
will, but in the common life of the race itself (qn. 6, 7). ‘⁴ Our nature
is become so corrupt, that we are all conceived and born in sin.⁷' The
evil is deep and broad as humanity itself, and not of a kind therefore to
be ever surmounted by the individual man in himself considered. This
at once strikes at the root of all Pelagianism. The ruinis organic,
and as such, needs an organic redemption—a redemption of humanity
in its wholeness first of all, as the only way of bringing true deliver-
ance to any particular or single life embraced in this whole. That
which is born of the fiesh, the nature of man in its fallen state, is fiesh,
and in and of itself must ever remain such3 can never leave itself
behind; can never transcend really and truly its own sphere (qu. 8).
