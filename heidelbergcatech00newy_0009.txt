PREFAOE.

Tms volume has been prepared by a Committee of the Synod of the German
Reformed Church in the United States, appointed at the annual meeting held at
Harrisburg, Pa„ in 18593 and is designed to commemorate the Three Hundredth
Anniversary of the formation and adoption of the Heidelberg Catechism. ¹

The resolution under which the Committee was appointed, orders ἲ( the prepara-
tion of a critical standard edition of the Heidelberg Catechism in the original Ger-
man, and Latin, together with a revised English translation, and an historical intro-
duction, to be published in superior style as a centennial edition, in 1863.” Agree—
ably to these instructions, we publish a comprehensive historical and theological
Introduction, and a critical edition of the Catechism in four texts: Old German,
Latin, Modern German, and English, printed in parallel columns.

The Introduction furnishes a succinet but full account of the origin and forma-
tion of the Catechism, its reception in the different branches of the Protestant
Ohurch, and its fortunes in Europe and America3 and compares its genius and the-
ology With that of other Reformed and Lutheran confessions, both of earlier and
later date.

It has not been considered desirable to accompany the text, from page to page,
with notes and references to authorities. It may suffice to state, that for its histori-
cal material in particular, use has been made mainly of the following works: HENRY
AL'nNG’s Historia cle Ecclesiz‘s Palatinis ,· J. CHR. Kocnm's Kateclzeciscke Ge-
sclzichte der Reformirten Kirclze ; PLANCK'S Geselzichte der protestantischen Πιθο-
loqie ; HENRY SmoN VAN ALPEN’S aeschielzte und Literatur des Heidelb. Kate-
chz'smus ; J. Ome. W. Aucusn’s Einleitunq in die beiden Haupt-Kateclzismen der
