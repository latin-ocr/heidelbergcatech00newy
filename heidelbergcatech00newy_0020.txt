12 HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION.

THE PALATINATE AN D THE REFORMATION.

The title Palatinate (Psalle) belonged formerly to two adjoining
provinces of Germany, which were distinguished as Upper and Lower.
The first (Obeyyofalz) bordered on Bohemia and Bavaria3 the other
(Ummpfalz) was situated on both sides of the Rhine, touching on
different sides Mayence, Wirtemberg, Baden, Alsace, and Lorraine. It
is frequently styled the Palatinam of 25]ae Rham, and has always been
known as one of the most fertile regions of Germany. The political
divisions and changes to which the whole country has been subjected,
in the progress of history, render it difficult to identify it on a
modern map.

Heidelberg, the ancient capital of the Palatinate, became conspicuous,
at an early date, in the history of learning, by its celebrated university,
established in the latter part of the fourteenth century. The founder of
this noble institution, to whose influence Germany stands indebted for
so much of her cultivation, was the Elector Rupere, surnamed froni the
color of his beard the Red. The undertaking was solemnly sanctioned
by a bull of Pope Urban VIâ€ž A. 1385, in which Heidelberg is declared
especially worthy, by the salubrity of its air and the fruitfulness of the
surrounding country, to become such a general fountain of science.
The new university was required to conform to the model of the insti-
tution at Paris, and was endowed also with the same rights and privi-
leges. Throughout the following century, we find in the Palatinate a
wholesome influence at work, in connection with this seat of learning,
in favor of letters and religion3 which contributed largely, no doubt,
in the midst of all adverse agencies, toward the general movement that
served to usher in subsequently the great age of the Reformation.
