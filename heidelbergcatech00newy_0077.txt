as it prevailed both in Germany and Holland, tended to multiply
commentaries and expositions of every sort on the small but mighty
text book, which lay at its foundation. Koeher, in his Catechetical
History of the Reformed Church, gives us notices, in alphabetical
order, of more than a hundred such workS, besides referring to a
number of others not so well known. A simple glance at this
catalogue, bristling with such names as Beelsnyder, Groenewegen,
Van der Hagen, Hakvoord, Van Hattem, Van Hoeke, Van der Steeg,
Van der Hooght, Van der Keinp, Van Pothoysen, Venhuysen, and
others of like sound, is sufficient to show that the main part of this
literature belongs to the Dutch. The best in either language, how-
ever, was commonly translated into the other; while quite a number
of these publications on both sides appeared originally in Latin. A
number of them were highly popular in their time, and passed
through many editions. Deserving of special notice in this view is
the “Golden Jewel'’ of John D’Outrein, published originally at
Amsterdam, 1719, in the Dutch language3 afterward translated into
German3 and then diligently revised and enlarged by Frederick
Adolphus Lampe. This large work has been honored with edition
after edit-ion, and may be said indeed to have carried with it, for a
time, a sort of symbolica] authority for ininisters and teachers, both in
Germany and Holland. Peter De Witte’s Commentary, Amsterdam,
1658, translated into English as well as German, was also repub-
lished a great many times, and had an immense reputation. Of earlier
date, 1617, the work of Festus Hommius for a long time was more in
use perhaps than any other3 which, however, seems to have been
a collection or compilation from different sources, beginning with
Ursinus himself, rather than an original exposition by the author
whose name it bears.
