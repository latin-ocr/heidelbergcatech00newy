96 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

where it has come to be apprehended with true faith, in the spirit of
St. Peter’s memorable confession, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
Livinq θοαί, is found to involve, with inward, necessary, historical
consequence, all the other articles of the symbol, out to the resurrection
of the body and the life everlasting. Where the Creed is allowed to
exert its natural and proper influence, as the original norm of all right
Christian thinking, we shall have always a theology and a church life
materially different from what will be found to prevail where this is
not the case. By holding the mind to the true Christological and
historical point of observation, it serves to keep it from the error of a
merely speculative or metaphysical construction of Christian doctrine.
A theology which flows in the order of the Creed, and breathes the
spirit of the Creed, becomes in this way concrete, and not simply
abstract; organic, and not simply logical and systemati03 historical,
and not simply dogmatic3 and with all this churchly also and sacra-

It follows then, that where the system of religious thought has
already fallen away seriously from this order, there will be no proper
sense for the symbolica] authority of the Creed, and no power to use
it in a free and natural way. It could not be incorporated at all, for
example, into the Westminster Catechism; which, with all its merits,
moves from first to last in a wholly different order of thought. It

fully answerable in all respects to the genius of the Creed, or that the
Creed finds in it everywhere its natural sense and right exposition.
We can easily enough see, that a theological interest is allowed at
times to bend the symbol from its true course ; as in the arbitrary
