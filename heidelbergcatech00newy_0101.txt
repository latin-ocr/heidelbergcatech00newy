HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 91

redemption, and finally in the fruits of righteousness which spring from
the j0yful, believing apprehension of such great mercy. The concep-
tion is easy and simple, but at the same time profound and comprehen-
sive; and we may readily see, what a vast improvement it brings with
it at once into the whole organization of catechetical instruction.

We have the old material still, the Dec-alogue, the Creed, the
Lord's Prayer, with the Church and Sacraments; but it is no longer 111
1110 form of so many separate parts, put together in merely outward
conjunction, or subordinated at best to a speculative scheme of
divinity3 they are worked up into the general subject to which they
belong, according to what may be called the law of its own inward
movement and progress Thus, although the first part of the Cate-
chism has to do with the knowledge of sin, which comes only through
the knowledge of law, we are not referred at once for this purpose, as
in Luther’s Catechism, to a formal explication of the Ten Command-
ments. “The Decalogue,'' says Ursinus, “belongs to the first part so
far as it 15 0 11111101 of our 5111 and misery, but also to the third ⁸part as
being the rule of our new obedience and Christian life.” With good
Judgment, accordingly, the consideration of it in detail is reserved for
this ethical sphere ; while simply the sum of the law, as given by our
Saviour Himself, is employed to bring its scattered rays to a burning
focus, in the first part, on the fact of our common human depravity,
considered in its spiritual principle and root (qn. 4). In the second
part, then, we have the Creed and the Sacraments, and along with the
Ten Commandments, in the third part, also the Lord's Prayer. There
is a beautiful order in this way, from first to last, in which all these
catechetical elements seem to find their appropriate place, and by
means of which they enter naturally and easily into the constitution
of the work as a whole.
