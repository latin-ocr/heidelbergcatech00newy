HISTORIOAL INTRODUCTION. 43

direction to its whole life3 and it is no wonder, therefore, that it drew
upon itself almost immediately the excited attention of all neighboring
lands. For Germany in particular, it was a fact of most ominous
significance, carrying in it nothing less than a principle of disorder and
revolution for the whole Protestant German Church. It was the lift-
ing up of what was felt to be the Calvinistic or Reformed standard in
the land of Luther himself, where its erection seemed to involve, not
only treason to his doctrine, but injury also to his memory and name. Α
