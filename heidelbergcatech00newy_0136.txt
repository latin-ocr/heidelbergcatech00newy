has been called a resuscitation of the Heidelberg Catechism in the new
Gatechism of Baden, as well as in other Catechisms lately produced
for the use of the Evangelical Union in Germany; and along with
this a general reawakening of interest in the formulary, which has

purpose of division, but to make room rather for the end of all strife,
through the full integration of the doctrine of Christ, on a higher
plane, under a new, more broadly catholic and perfect form.
