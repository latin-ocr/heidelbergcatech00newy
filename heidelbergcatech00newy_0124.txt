1 1 4 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

'factors of the new creation in Christ J esus, they throw themselves
upon the purely subjective side of the process3 making the work of
Christianity to be an inward transaction wholly between each indi-

and is but too apparent everywhere in those denominations also which
still profess to make account of their historical descent from the age of
the Reformation. Neither the Lutheran Ohurch, nor any part of the
