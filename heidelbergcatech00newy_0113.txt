HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 103

this relation, has sought to instil into them, from the first, the con-
sciousness and sense of their being Christians, as the necessary condi-
tion of their growing up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
In this way also Christianity is made to be a matter of persona]
appropriation throughout, in all the early Creeds3 they move in the
orbit of the Christian life itself, and not on the outside of it 3 they are
the language of saith for the faithful only. The spirit of the Catechism

always for a holy life. “Ye are bought with a price ’⁷ (1 Cor. 6: 20,
in the very spirit of the lst question of the Catechism), “therefore
