110 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

whatever in that which lay at the foundation of all this old Chris-
tianity, a gracious condition, namely, supposed to be already at hand
in the case of all who belonged rightfully to the Church, in virtue of
which they were considered to be no longer nature or flesh only, but
to have part also in the supernatura] economy of the Spirit. The
capacity for Christianity which Pelagius heretically pretended to find
in the birth of nature, St. Augustine referred to a higher birth of
grace, which was effected, as he believed, by the sacrament of Baptism ;
and in one form or another, the same view substantially has always
been held, wherever the idea of educational religion has been found to
carry with ‘it any sort of practica] force.

Only in such view, indeed, can we understand what educational
religion means, or have any right sense of what it is to bring up our
children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. In some way we
must be assured that they belong to Christ, and not to Satan, if we
are to encourage in them at all the Christian consciousness, which the
conception of such culture implies from the very start. There must
be a basis here on which to build——not in nature merely, or our own
wilful imagination, but in grace 3 of whose presence, then, we need to
have some outwardly objective evidence and pledge. In that case, it
will be possible for us to look upon our children as Christians from
the beginning, and so to make them the subjects of a positively
Christian culture throughout, according to the injunction of St. Paul,
for which otherwise there would be no room whatever. Then reli-
gious education for the young will not be negative merely, an outward
discipline intended to prepare the way for Christ at some future time,
or a moral training for the purposes only of the present life ; nor will
it stand simply in lessons and rules presented to the understanding;
but it will aim rather, as all true education does, to reach its subjects
