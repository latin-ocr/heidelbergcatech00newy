62 HISTORIOAL INTRODUOTION.

accordingly, we have disclosed to our view, with the advance of time,
the presence of Reformed Views and principles in distinction from the
Lutheran, and in different lands a more or less general profession of
the Reformed faith. In these lands we hear of various Catechisms,
which secured for themselves a certain amount of respect and use.
In the end, however, we find them all either supplanted altogether, or
made to take a secondary character and rank, by the Catechism of
the Palatinate3 which attained in this way to a sort of universal
authority, as the leading symbol of the Church. In J uliers, Cleves,
and Berg, it was early introduced into the churches and schools3 and
in 1580 it was invested in form with the full authority of an
ecclesiastica] standard. So afterward in Hesse Cassel, Anhalt, and
the several free cities which had embraced the Reformed faith. It

German Reformed Church at large, in its difference from the other
great Protestant Confession. Hence we find even in Prussia, at the
beginning of the last century, a royal order, requiring all ministers of
Reformed congregations to lecture on the Heidelberg Catechism every
Sabbath afternoon, according to the practice observed in Holland.

As in the Palatinate, so likewise in Germany at large, this sym-

contradiction it endured both from Lutherans and Romanists. It
was a sign everywhere to be spoken against by the enemies of the
Reformed faith. The notable soth question, in particular, was laid
hold of by Catholics, as a favorable occasion at all times for holding
it up to reproach. In some caseS, when it was known that the
minister was to preach upon this question, troublesome persons would
slip into the church for the purpose of creating interruption and
disorder. Not unfrequently, fanatica] well-fed monks might be heard,
