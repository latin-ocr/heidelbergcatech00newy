has been allowed to rule the course of theology, the Calvinistic theory
of the sacraments has gradually lost its meaning altogether; whereas,

allowed to be of any real force in their favor. The party themselves
showed clearly enough that they felt the real sense of the Catechism
to be strongly against them, by their persevering endeavors to
