‚94 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.'

upon Him as often as we are in any need, secking safety in Him and
all desirable good3 and finally, by acknowledging Him, both with
heart and mouth, to be the sole author of all good things.'' This four-
fold scheme then is made to lead and rule the entire subsequent course
of instruction, imparting to it necessarily something of its own scho-
lastic complexion. Even the Apostles' Creed, in this way, fails to
exercise its proper power over the form and manner of religious
thought. It determines indeed the order of the first part; but the
