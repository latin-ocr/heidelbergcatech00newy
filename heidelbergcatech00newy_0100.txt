90 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

of thankfulness and the Lord⁷s Prayer3 and the fourth, of the Sacra-
ments. Lasky’s Catechism again has the same fourfold order, begin-
ning with the knowledge of God and the Ten Commandments. In
Calvin⁷s Catechism ‚we have the order partially changed: first the
Creed3 next the Decalogue3 then the Lord’s Prayer3 and finally the
Word and Sacraments 3-—all in answer to the general question: In
what manner is God to be rightly honored ἓ The difficulty with this
whole method is, that it runs almost necessarily into the form of mere
didactic representation. The teaching is made to hinge too much on
some speculative principle, and assumes a sort of outward character,
as a scheme of knowledge simply for the understanding. Christianity
comes to appear in this way a theory, rather than a living fact. It
is especially worthy of note now, that the preliminary, experimental
Catechisms of Ursinus (larger and smaller) were themselves con-
structed according to this general fashion, following in particular the
order of Calvin. But, strange to say, the Heidelberg Catechism came
out immediately after on another plan altogether. How the¹ authors
were led to it, we are not informed. It would seem to have some
connection with that idea of the Covenant of Gracc which entered so
largely, as we know, into the thinking of Olevianus, and is fore-
shadowed to some extent in the spirit of his previous Catechism for
children3 but there is evidence enough that it belongs also to the
independent judgment of Ursinus. Altogether the case is one of the
singularities that so strikingly characterize the authorship of the book.
The method 11616 followed, as it has often been remarked, is that
of St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (with the omission of chap.
9-11); a threefold division, namely, in which we have the fact of
Christianity represented in its own living, historical order, as it
appears first in the fallen condition of man, then in the work of “
