l 2 2 “ HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

must be confessed, that there is some show of reason for the charge,
so far at least as regards what may be considered the constitutional
tendency here of the Reformed Confession. Zuingli’s great fault, as
well as his chief strength, lay in the clear intellectuality of his nature.
Calvin had a deeper sense of the mystical, but along with this a still

come with him to its proper rights. His theory of the decreeS, for
example, does violence continually to his theory of the sacraments.
As we have it in the Heidelberg Catechism, however, the Reformed

writer expresses it, “ unsibertrefflich schon’⁷——beautiful in the highest
degree. This is to be understood, of course, as holding good especially
