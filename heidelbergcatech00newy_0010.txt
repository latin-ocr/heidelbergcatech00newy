Reference may be made properly, also, to J. W. NEvnv's History and Genius of
the Heidelber9 Cateclzism, published at Chambersburg, Pa„ in 1847.

The Catechism, as given in the first column, is the original text, the ipsissima
verba of the third edition of 1563. Failing in our endeavor to obtain, in Europe, a
copy of the edicio princeps, we have had recourse to the work of Dr. H. A. N ie-
meyer, entitled, Collectio Confessionum in Ecclesiis Reformatis Publieatarum,
Which furnishes the text as originally issued. We reprint it word for word, and
letter for letter3 with three exceptionS. We insert, as being evidently necessary to
complete the grammatical construction, the word “ ich ” after “Dasz” in the first
line of the fifty-second answer, so as to read: Dasz ich in allem Trsibsal3 and the
word “ wil ’⁷ before “ lehren,” in the second line of the seventy-third answer, 5ο 35
to read: Nit allein dz er vns damit wil lehren. We depart also from Niemeyer, by
putting in brackets the memorable addition to the eightieth answer, to indicate that,
whilst it belongs to the Catechism as approved by the Elector, Frederick the Picus,
as received by the Church of the Palatinate, and published in the third edition, it
is nevertheless not a part of the original Catechism as completed by the authors, as
first adopted by the Synod of the Palatinate, and published in the first edition,
which was accompanied by the celebrated proclamation of the Elector, under date
of the 19th of January, 15633 and that therefore, although authentic, it possesses
less ecclesiastical authority than the other portions of the answer.* For the same
general reason, we repeat the brackets in the other columns.

This original text is the ultimate standard of the Catechism. It is the norm by
which all subsequent editions in German, and all translations into other languages,
are to be judged. As such the Committee have regarded it 3 and 11315 consequently
omitted in the Modern German text and in the English translation, as being without
authority, all words and phrases which have been added in the Latin and introduced
into later German editions, but are not warranted by the German edition of 1563.
